It looks like cluster '0' and cluster '2' have centroids that are fairly close together, while cluster '1' has a centroid that is a little further away. The model only took 5 iterations to converge, which was a lot fewer than I expected. I suspect this is because we are working with a smaller dataset and perhaps the clusters are fairly distinct. However, the sum squared error and the silhouette score work against this hypothesis, as the model only had a score of .51, which is a pretty bad silhouette score. This means that there were likely points that the K-Means algorithm labeled as a certain cluster, that really should have been assigned to another cluster. If I were guessing, I would say that the silhouette score would improve if the K-Means model was trained for a different number of centroids."

However, they ended with roughly the same silhouette score with HAC scoring a .54, which was around .03 better than the K-Means model. In class we discussed that using complete linkage in HAC often finds more compact clusters, which I would assume applies to the clusters in this dataset. We also discussed that ward linkage is often the most suitable method for quantitative features, so my prediction is that if a HAC model was trained using ward linkage, it would do better than both the K-Means and the complete linkage model."
